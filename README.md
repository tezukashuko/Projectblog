* Create, read, ~~update, delete~~ (update soon) account

_**- Use db.php to edit the account of your database**_

_Note: An included SQL has admin account (admin,admin). When accounts are created, the default role is set as a member. It can re-role by edit in DTB, I do not program some strings to activate admin role._
